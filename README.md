Proposal for Web Development Final Project: Weather App

Introduction:

Our team of five members, consisting of Adeeb Fahim, Olivia Taylor, Ethan Franks, Tarnvir Hans, and Zhenhong Zhong, is proposing a full-stack web application for the final project. Our proposed project is a Weather App that aims to provide accurate and up-to-date weather information to users. Additionally, the app will have other features such as news, horoscopes, account registration, and more. The app will be designed to be user-friendly, interactive, and visually appealing to attract and retain users.

Team Structure:

Olivia will serve as the team leader responsible for overseeing the project's development, managing the team's progress, and ensuring that the project goals are met. She is also in charge of front-end design and will be the final say in any new website features or design edits.
Adeeb and Tarnvir will be responsible for back-end development and will be tasked with creating the app's server-side functionality, such as integrating weather APIs and database management. 
Ethan and Kevin will be responsible for front-end development, creating the app's user interface, and ensuring that the app is responsive across different devices. Ethan will also be presenting and explaining the website’s features and progress to the client (Our instructor).

Proposed Features:

Accurate and up-to-date weather information: Users will be able to search for weather information for any location worldwide, including real-time temperature, humidity, precipitation, and wind speed. The app will use APIs to source this information and will display it in a user-friendly manner. The user will also be able to click a “Use My Current Location” button for our website to locate their location and provide local, up-to-date weather information to them.
News: The app will display relevant news articles to users based on their location and weather information. 
Horoscopes: Users will be able to access daily horoscopes. The website will determine their sign based on a birth date textbox prompted when signing up.
Quotes: account members will have the member-exclusive quote area of the site where they will see an inspirational/bible/funny quote when they access the website. This feature will be optional (checkbox in signup form).
Account registration: Users will be able to create and manage their accounts, which will allow them to customize their app settings/widgets, save their favorite locations, and receive personalized weather alerts.

Technology Stack:

Front-end: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Back-end: NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB
APIs: OpenWeatherMap API, NewsAPI, Horoscope API

Conclusion:

In summary, our team proposes a full-stack web application, a Weather App that will provide weather information and additional features such as news, horoscopes, and account registration. The app will be developed using modern web technologies and APIs to ensure a seamless user experience. Our team is excited to undertake this project, and we are confident in our ability to deliver a high-quality web app
